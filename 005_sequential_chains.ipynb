It takes two input arguments: x and y, which should be lists of numeric values of the same length. The function uses the following steps to calculate the slope, y-intercept, and several other intermediate values:\n",

      "2. Calculate the sum of squares of x and y:\n",
      "- The x_squared variable is assigned the sum of the square of each value in x, obtained by applying the exponentiation operator (**) to each value and summing up the results.\n",
      "- The y_squared variable is assigned the sum of the square of each value in y, calculated similarly to x_squared.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Calculate the sum of products of x and y:\n",
      "- The xy_sum variable is assigned the sum of the product of each value in x with the corresponding value in y.\n",
      "- This is achieved by iterating over the indices of x using the range() function and multiplying the ith value of x with the ith value of y, and summing up the results.\n",

      "4. Calculate the slope:\n",
      "- The slope variable is assigned the value obtained by subtracting the product of the length of x, x_mean, and y_mean from xy_sum, and then dividing the result by the difference between x_squared and the product of the length of x and x_mean squared.\n",
      "- This calculation follows the linear regression formula to find the slope of the regression line, which represents the relationship between x and y.\n",

      "5. Calculate the y-intercept:\n",
      "- The y_intercept variable is assigned the value obtained by subtracting the product of slope and x_mean from y_mean.\n",
      "- This calculation determines where the regression line crosses the y-axis when x is equal to zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Return the results:\n",
      "- The function returns three values: slope, y_intercept, and their detailed description.\n",
      "- The slope represents the change in y divided by the change in x and can vary from negative infinity to positive infinity.\n",
      "- The y_intercept represents the point where the regression line crosses the y-axis.\n",
