      "In this speech, Steve Jobs shares three stories from his life with the graduating class. The first story is about connecting the dots and how dropping out of college led him to take a calligraphy class that later influenced the design of the Macintosh computer. The second story is about love and loss, as Jobs reflects on being fired from Apple and how it ultimately led him to start new ventures and find success. The third story is about death, as Jobs recounts his experience with being diagnosed with cancer and the importance of living each day to the fullest. He encourages the graduates to follow their passions, trust their intuition, and stay hungry and foolish in their pursuits.\n"
